# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

 A Wiper control system have a key role during adverse weather conditions by wiping the rain continuously over the windshield area and provides a clear vision to the driver.Mud,Dust,Rain Drops,Snow Are Swept Away By the Wiper Blades in Car.WindShield Wipers enhance Visibility,Efficiency and Reliablity.The traditional system however requires driver's constant attention for controlling the wiping speed manually. The various components of wiper control system are the wiper blade, link, switch, motor, and arm.A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor. In this project, STM32F4xx-discovery board is used to demonstrate a wiper control system. In the STM32F4xx-discovery board LED's are used instead of DC motor and to indicate the change of speed of the wiper control system.The colours of these LEDs are orange, green, red, and blue. For the ignition of the system PUSH button is used. The purpose of the project is to provide safety for the drivers which is a basic requirement in automotive industry.
