A Wiper control system have a key role during adverse weather conditions by wiping the rain continuously over the windshield area and provides a clear vision to the driver.Mud,Dust,Rain Drops,Snow Are Swept Away By the Wiper Blades in Car.WindShield Wipers enhance Visibility,Efficiency and Reliablity.The traditional system however requires driver's constant attention for controlling the wiping speed manually. The various components of wiper control system are the wiper blade, link, switch, motor, and arm.A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor. In this project, STM32F4xx-discovery board is used to demonstrate a wiper control system. In the STM32F4xx-discovery board LED's are used instead of DC motor and to indicate the change of speed of the wiper control system.The colours of these LEDs are orange, green, red, and blue. For the ignition of the system and change in the speed, PUSH button is used. The purpose of the project is to provide safety for the drivers which is a basic requirement in automotive industry.

# Components & Features

#### STM32F407VG Microcontroller Board 

* STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. 
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded. It has upto 1 Mbyte of Flash memory, 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM,512 bytes of OTP memory,Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories. It has 3 V and 5 V external application power supply.

#### Software Requirements

* STM32 CUBE IDE is used for the software simulation. STM32CubeProgrammer (STM32CubeProg) provides an all-in-one software tool to program STM32 devices in any environment: multi-OS, graphical user interface or command line interface, support for a large choice of connections (JTAG, SWD, USB, UART, SPI, CAN, I2C), with manual operation or automation through scripting.

# SWOT Analysis

## Strength

* Low cost
* Better Battery life as ARM Processors have better battery life.
* Power consumption is less.
* Low latency and gives quicker response time.

## Weakness

* Implementation costs are high due to the sensors.

## Opportunity

* It is designed to provide adequate visibility to the drivers.
* Must safety measure.

## Threats

* Noise can occur due to the machinery.

# 4W's and 1H
